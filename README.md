# Introduction

## What is Zesty.io?

Zesty.io is a cloud web content management system (WCMS) that is API driven with open-source user interfaces. Our software is built to automate the configuration, optimization, and distribution of digital content so marketing teams and developers can focus on creating excellent digital experiences.

### What makes Zesty.io different?

We architected Zesty.io to meet the needs of any content usage such as a [traditional website](services/web-engine/) CMS, a [Headless CMS API](tools/code-examples/) interface, a modern JamStack (JavaScript, API, Markup) implementation, or a combination of solutions. This means Zesty.io can power content beyond websites into new digital mediums like smart devices, video game data, and mobile applications. As a cloud service, we are constantly improving our technology, often daily, with updates that positively affect all users and experiences built on the platform.

With the diversity of client needs as our focal point, we built an ecosystem that has an straightforward workflow.  Its construction revolved around the expectation that content creation shouldn't be limited to engineering departments. Continual assessments and updates are preformed to ensure a streamlined interface accessible for marketers, content creators and developers. In the Quick Start Guide below, we provide the layout and navigational guide to creating your first project.

We see content as a blank canvas, and because of that, we made a system that allows for any content configuration that is easy for any user to work with.

We started by delivering a product that can make quick, easy, but powerful web experiences. We continue that tradition by continuing to approve and add features to our [Web Engine](services/web-engine/). Learn how to use Zesty.io with these platform tours and guides.

Traditionally, content is siloed to the experience it was created for, and often locked up the software installation it was created on. With Zesty.io, content can be shared between different instances and experiences built outside of the Zesty.io system.

Experiences need to be delivered fast. Whether it is a JSON API call or a full website page loading, we make sure that all requests are cached at the edge to ensure your end user is delivered a fast experience without thinking about load time or uptime.

The ability to repurpose content to work on multiple devices like phones, browsers, and smart devices gives business' marketing teams and developers the upper hand with non-siloed content and short term experiences.

### The Core Technology Behind Zesty.io

Zesty.io was born in the cloud. The primary infrastructure lives on **Google Cloud Platform** and uses **Fastly** for edge caching. Core code of the system is built in **Golang** and **NodeJS**. User interfaces are built in React. Zesty.io was originally built in PHP with a custom Mootools user interface.
